sends hidden messages for player's deck

you can also play against the ai - granted the ai plays like a 5 year old kid who just learned how to play, it doesn't make smart moves

the "**Name**<-Ai 1<-Ai 2" means that it's names turn currently (hence the bold) and next turn it will be Ai2's turn. the arrows flip when an uno reverse card is played.
